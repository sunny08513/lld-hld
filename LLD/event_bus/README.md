1. Define Requirements

Publish-Subscribe Pattern: The event bus should allow publishers to emit events and subscribers to listen for these events.
Decoupling: Publishers and subscribers should not need to know about each other.
Scalability: The system should handle a large number of events and subscribers.
Reliability: Ensure events are reliably delivered and processed.
Flexibility: Allow different types of events and dynamic subscription management.

2. Core Components
Event: A message or notification that something has happened.
Publisher: A component that sends events to the event bus.
Subscriber: A component that listens for and processes events from the event bus.
Event Bus: The central component that manages the distribution of events to subscribers.
